Inheritance
-Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP where a new class
(subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors (methods
and attributes) from an existing class (superclass or base class). It
promotes code reuse and allows creating specialized classes based on
existing ones.

Encapsulation
-Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods
(functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). Access to
the data is controlled through access modifiers, ensuring that the
internal state of an object is hidden from the outside world.

Polymorphism
-Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as
objects of a common superclass. It enables the same method to behave
differently based on the specific class of the object. This promotes
flexibility and extensibility in code design.

Abstraction
-Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling
classes based on their essential properties and behaviors. Abstract
classes define methods without providing implementations, leaving the
implementation details to subclasses.

Composition
-Composition is the practice of building complex objects by combining
simpler components. Instead of relying solely on inheritance,
composition allows creating more flexible and modular designs.
